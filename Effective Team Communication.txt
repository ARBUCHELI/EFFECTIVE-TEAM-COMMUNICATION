# EFFECTIVE TEAM COMMUNICATION
------------------------------
It's vital to maintain open, effective communication when working on a team. However, it's all too easy for teams to adopt bad habits. Without realizing how badly it affects your team,  
you or another team member may communicate in ways that lead to misunderstandings in teamwork, cause unnecessary conflict, keep others from having their say, and prevent collaboration.

In this course, you'll learn about different verbal barriers to effective team communication and strategies for overcoming them. But speaking is only one part of communication; effective 
team leadership is about listening too. 

So you'll also learn about some active listening techniques that can help you be a better listener when managing teams.
