# EFFECTIVE TEAM COMMUNICATION
------------------------------
It's vital to maintain open, effective communication when working on a team. However, it's all too easy for teams to adopt bad habits. Without realizing how badly it affects your team,  
you or another team member may communicate in ways that lead to misunderstandings in teamwork, cause unnecessary conflict, keep others from having their say, and prevent collaboration.

In this course, you'll learn about different verbal barriers to effective team communication and strategies for overcoming them. But speaking is only one part of communication; effective 
team leadership is about listening too. 

So you'll also learn about some active listening techniques that can help you be a better listener when managing teams.

* Effective Team Communication
------------------------------
Open, effective communication is vital on a team.

However, people aren't born good communicators. They become good at communicating effectively by working at it and honing their skills.

In this course, you'll learn about common verbal barriers on teams and ways to overcome them. But speaking is only one part of communication - effective listening is vital too.

So you'll also learn about specific active listening techniques that can help you listen more effectively.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Verbal Barriers: Jargon and Bluffing
--------------------------------------
Barriers to communication can result in weak team performance. And they can drain team members' energy. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (I see that the main developer of the project who is
Vitaly is doing a big effort for keeping all members of the team informed about the current state of our current goal that is the culmination of the demo). We need to promote these kinds
of good practices inside of our team.

. One example of a communication barrier - one that's common in workplaces - is jargon. **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(The day of the presentation in front of Gazprom, is better to don't try to impress the Gazprom representative, using too much technical language that belongs to the field of software 
development, is better to focus in their goals, and in how the product can help them to become more efficient and improve their own resource management.

. Example:
----------
AKIRA: The client is breathing down my neck. I think we should just go ahead with the black-box testing. You know...get the QA process rolling. We're going with CMMI version 1.3.
Better start with the CM and CAR process areas. Everyone okay with that?

MARY: I have no idea what Akira's talking about! I don't want everyone to know I'm so out of the loop though. Maybe I can ask a friend after the meeting.

Jargon is language that's used by a specific profession or group.

. Examples? Abbreviations and acronyms like 

QA, 
CMMI, 
CM, 
CAR.

And technical terms, like black-box testing.

The problem with jargon? It's specialized. Not everyone is familiar with it. Using it can keep people from understanding...keep them from getting information they need.

It can also make team members feel isolated. So try to limit your use of jargon. And if you have to use it, explain your terms to make sure everyone is on the same page.

Let's return to the team meeting.

AKIRA: So Mary, are you okay with everything so far?
MARY: Yes, sure. That's fine. CM and CAR,

Mary just did something quite natural. She pretended to understand something.

She didn't want to appear uninformed in front of her team mates. 

. That's a second kind of verbal barrier to communication. It's called bluffing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It involves making up responses when you're asked questions you don't know the answers to. Bluffing can hold back a team and keep people from really understanding what needs to be done 
and from moving forward.

AKIRA: So Mary, what we talked about this morning - what progress have you made?

MARY: Actually, I'm not sure what you wanted me to do.

AKIRA: Oh. But our deadline is coming up.

I thought you said you were okay with everything.

MARY: I'm sorry. I don't actually know what CMMI is. I didn't understand.

That's another problem with bluffing.

For the person who does it, it tends to backfire. You can end up looking foolish, irresponsible even, when people find out you pretended to know something you didn't.
**** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (This happened several times at the beginning of the project, and for that reason it took too long to complete the demo).

And if you bluff too often, people might stop listening to you even when you do know what you're talking about.

So keep jargon in check and banish bluffing.

Avoiding these kinds of barriers can help people on a team communicate better.

And when everyone on the team understands one another and communicates openly, the team will perform at its best.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Verbal Barriers: Polarize, Screen, and Crush ideas
----------------------------------------------------
Bad communication habits can get in the way of effective communication on a team.

A team's productivity can be damaged by a number of communication barriers.

For example, when a team member uses jargon that not everyone will understand.

Another barrier is bluffing. That's making up responses when asked questions you don't know the answers to.

A third barrier to smooth communication is using language that polarizes a team.

LAUREN: Obviously, we should go with the designs on the left.
AKIRA: Wait a minute. I'm not sure about that. I don't really like the way it's structured.
LAUREN: No, the one on the left is way better! Ashley, Mary, you're with me?

* Polarize ideas
----------------
When one or more team members can't or won't compromise, it can polarize a team, split it into separate "camps" or "sides." And when a team is divided like that, people work against 
each other- and communication doesn't flow smoothly.

Consider how the team could have managed things better, without using polarizing language.

LAUREN: I prefer this design because it's simple and straightforward. What does everyone else think?

AKIRA: I think the navigation buttons on the other design are more user friendly.

LAUREN: Well, let's use the best ideas from both designs. Can you draw something up, Mary?

Another communication barrier is screening.

* Screening ideas **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (This is exactly what's happening in this company, we have a member team that is screaning the ideas of everyone else).
-----------------
That's blocking out or ignoring constructive criticism from team members.

Ever experience something similar in your team Ashley?

ASHLEY: Sure have. When I spoke to Akira about missing his deadlines, he didn't acknowledge my comment at all. He just went on talking, like I didn't say anything.

It's likely Akira screened out what Ashley said to avoid having an uncomfortable conversation. But screening like that also blocks out constructive criticism.

It can keep you from learning how to do things better.

And it can discourage people on a team from bothering to give their input next time.

* Crushing ideas **** GAZPROM PROJECT **** (This is exactly what's happening in this company, we have a member team that is crushing the ideas of everyone else).
----------------
Crushing ideas, sometimes without a moment's thought, is a final barrier to communication.

Let's revisit the team meeting again while they're discussing ways to breathe new life into one of their game apps.

MARY: Summer vacation is around the corner. Why don't we give the splash screen a bit of a seasonal tone? You know, stay true to the brand, but give it an update.

AKIRA: That will be far too confusing. We need to be consistent.

If you're not open to other peoples' ideas, if you criticize automatically, chances are your team mates will stop sharing their ideas with you at all.

And that can hurt you and your team, and you are going to end up working alone.

When you know what kinds of barriers affect communication on your team, you can take steps to break them down, to communicate in more open, positive ways. And that can transform your 
team, making everyone happier and more productive.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Strategies for Maintaining Open Communication
-----------------------------------------------
Certain behaviors like unintentionally using jargon that not everyone understands, or crushing other people's ideas, can get in the way of good communication on a team.

Luckily, there are ways to combat these.

One way to maintain open communication is to create a safe environment for team meetings.

Communication can flow when people know it's safe to speak up; that nobody will make them feel like they have bad ideas or ask dumb questions.

To do this, to create an atmosphere of trust and open communication, you need to set some ground rules for everyone on the team to follow.

How did you guys do this on your team, Ashley? 

ASHLEY: After a few unproductive meetings, we sat down and decided on some rules. Like nobody should interrupt. Let whoever's speaking finish. Plus we agreed to stop working at cross 
purposes, not to trivialize anybody's contribution, or argue before everyone's had their say.

MARY: I feel much more relaxed in our meetings now.

It's clearer we're all working together, trying to get to the same place.

Another way to open up communication is to make a point of asking questions.

Speak up, and get clarification when you don't understand something.

MARY: When the programmers on the team get enthusiastic about an idea, sometimes it's hard for me to follow. They start talking in jargon. So when someone else asked what one of the 
acronyms meant I actually learned something.

Sometimes asking questions doesn't help just you, it can help other people on the team too - people who didn't understand but maybe weren't ready to speak up and say so.

So if you suspect that someone else isn't following, a good approach is to ask for clarification.

A third strategy for opening up communication is maintaining unity on the team.

Every team has to meet objectives, solve problems, and make good decisions.

But this can happen only when all team members pull together and support each other.

Let's find out from Ashley - how do you keep your team working together when they're at odds about an issue?

ASHLEY: Well, recently some team members were arguing about who's responsible for what.

I reminded them of the team's goals. 

What we're all working together to achieve. That helped everyone get more focused.

Great. 

You want to look for areas where you can agree and resolve conflict as quickly as possible.

Maintaining effective communication on a team isn't always easy.

But by using the right strategies, you can remove barriers and get everyone talking more openly.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Overcoming Barriers to Communication in Meetings
--------------------------------------------------
Meetings typically involve many people, each with their own ideas and ways of thinking. So the trick is to ensure everyone is on the same page.

There are a number of strategies you can use to overcome barriers to open communication. Creating a safe environment for team meetings - that can overcome a few of the common 
communication barriers.

. First, it helps prevent screening. That's because when people feel safe, they're less defensive. So make sure any criticism is well considered and not directed at the individual. 

. That kind of thing. Then people will be more open to accept criticism and be objective about it.

ASHLEY: I think our meetings started going much better after we'd set some ground rules. Listened to each other's ideas properly before responding.

Akira, I know you have a lot on your plate right now, but I'm concerned about your lack of attention to detail lately. It's making it difficult for others on the team.

AKIRA: I understand. Show me where I'm going wrong. 

When team members feel safe, bluffing also becomes less common. Why? Because people don't feel like they have to pretend.

When they don't know something - don't understand - they can speak up.

MARY: Once our meetings got more constructive, I felt better about sharing my ideas. Like everyone else would really listen.

That's an advantage of a safe meeting environment. It puts a stop to people crushing ideas. 

. Another strategy for opening up communication - get clarification if you don't understand something. Don't be afraid. Speak up!

Let's consider how Lauren does this.

LAUREN: The bank now wants us to show blue chip stocks in our app too.

MARY: Can someone remind me - what counts as blue chip stocks?

LAUREN: Actually, I'm not really sure. I'll find out.

Asking questions is a great way to respond to jargon that not everyone understands.

It's also useful for preventing bluffing.

When you make it clear you don't always know everything, it gets easier for others to admit they don't either.

. A final strategy to help remove barriers to effective communication - maintain unity on the team.

Sometimes a team is divided, and you have to work at bringing everyone together.

MARY: For a while, it felt like getting anything done was a struggle.

Someone on the team would always argue.

Then Ashley pointed out what we need to achieve for the client.

How we're all really going to have to pull together to get everything done.

. Maintaining unity on a team helps prevent team members from becoming polarized, from dividing into different camps. You can also maintain team unity by identifying compromises. Focus on 
moving forward, instead of on competition, or on "who wins." Create an atmosphere of open communication on your team, and you'll find that everyone starts to realize the benefits of 
pulling together, of being part of a cohesive team rather than a divided one.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The Importance of Active Listening
------------------------------------
On a team, good communication isn't just about talking. It's also about listening.

. When you're with teammates, you should practice active listening.

This means actively taking in what the speaker is saying without adding input of your own.

. With active listening, you encourage the speaker to continue talking and to clarify what they're saying. It's a speaker-centered process. It gives the speaker implicit permission to 
continue talking.

. When you actively listen to your team mates instead of just hearing the words they're saying, it can have several benefits.

Let's consider how Ashley puts active listening into practice on her team.

AKIRA: I'm not entirely sure about our approach - about making users scroll vertically. It just doesn't feel right.

ASHLEY: Okay, go on.

AKIRA: I mean, it seems easier, more intuitive, to scroll horizontally here.

You know, like paging through the layers of a menu.

ASHLEY: So you're saying that it's a more instinctive way of moving through the app, right?

AKIRA: Yes. That's it.

Notice how Ashley listened, nodded, and leaned slightly towards Akira.

She made Akira feel like his opinion really mattered. When you allow team mates to talk freely, you will be better able to identify the potential problem areas of the project.

MARY: Well, I kind of assumed we'd go with mixed scrolling.

ASHLEY: Okay. Why?

MARY: That gives us the most real estate to play with. You know...it means users can move around a wider area.

HOST: So Mary and Akira have very different ideas on how users will navigate the app.

By listening to both of them, Ashley can reap another benefit of active listening - she can prepare better negotiation and conflict management strategies if need be.

Why? Because active listening can calm tensions, break communication deadlocks, and help you find areas for compromise during meetings.

When you listen actively, often it means you can make better decisions.

That's because you get more information from other people.

And you make sure that you fully understand what they say.

So really listen to your teammates.

It's not always easy, but if you get it right, it can improve your overall team communication and boost performance.
